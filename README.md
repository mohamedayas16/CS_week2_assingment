## Getting Started & Reproduction Instructions

Follow these steps to reproduce the environment and run the analysis on a clean machine:

### 1. Prerequisites
Ensure you have **Python 3.8+** installed. The project relies on the following core numerical and visualization libraries:
* Required packages:
  ```bash
  pip install numpy matplotlib scipy
  ```
### 2. Clone the repository
First, grab a local copy of the repository and switch into the project directory:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/mohamedayas16/CS_week2_assingment.git
  cd CS_week2_assingment
  ```
### 3. Run the computational analysis script
To process the data and generate the computational results and figures, run the main analysis script:
```bash
python src/analysis.py
```
### 4. Compile the report
If you want to re-generate the assignment PDF report from the LaTeX source:
```bash
pdflatex docs/report.tex
```
